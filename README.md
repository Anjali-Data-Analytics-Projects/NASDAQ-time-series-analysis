# Project Title
##  Financial Metrics: Time Series Analysis and Insights Using NASDAQ API Data

###  Business Problem

The goal of this project is to understand how key financial indicators(KPIs) for NASDAQ-listed companies have evolved over time, helping to identify trends, patterns, and potential influencing factors in the market.

+ **Objective:-** Leverage the **NASDAQ API** to fetch financial data, **perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **conduct Time series analysis** to uncover trends and patterns in **key performance indicators (KPIs)** across **different companies** examining how these KPIs **change over time** and understanding the underlying factors driving these changes.This comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into the financial health of companies, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions and strategic plans.

+ **Challenges:**
    + **Data Complexity and Volume**
         + **Multidimensional Data:-**
           
         + **Large Data Sets:-** 
     
    + **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
         + **Missing Values:-** 
     
         + **Outliers:-** 
     
         + **Data Types:-** 
    
    + **Data Aggregation** Choosing the right level of aggregation that balances detail and readability.

    + **Trend Identification and Analysis:**
         + **Identifying seasonal Patterns:-** Identifying specific seasonal trends in **specific quarters** due to seasonal factors, like reduced                                                     demand or production. Assessing seasonality consistency involving checking, whether these seasonal                                                      trends occur consistently every year, or if they are affected by other external factors. Recognizing                                                    these patterns helps businesses anticipate financial performance at different times of the year.
     
         + **Long-Term Trend Analysis:-** It refers to identifying sustained patterns of growth or decline in in key financial metrics performance,                                               over an extended period, typically **spanning multiple quarters or years**. It can be either cyclical or one-                                           time event. Cyclical Market Behavior refers to patterns in KPIs performance that repeat over regular                                                    intervals due to recurring factors in the economy, industry, or market.In contrast to cyclical trends, one-                                             time events are isolated occurrences that temporarily impact financial performance. 
         
    + **Handling Volatility and Anomalies**
        + **Understanding Volatility and Anomalies:-** Sudden financial shifts caused by global events like economic recessions, pandemics, or                                                                 geopolitical issues must be accounted for to prevent **skewed results**. Volatility refers to                                                           the degree of variation in financial metrics (e.g., stock prices, revenue, profit) over time.                                                           High volatility means larger swings in the data, while low volatility indicates more stability.
                                                       Volatility is short term or long term
                                                       Anomalies are data points or events that deviate significantly from the expected pattern or                                                             trend. These can be due to one-time events, data errors, or extraordinary circumstances.
                                                       Types of Anomalies:
                                                       Positive Anomalies: Unexpected spikes in financial metrics, such as a sharp increase in revenue                                                         due to the release of a highly successful product.
                                                       Negative Anomalies: Sudden drops in performance, such as a significant revenue decline due to a                                                         lawsuit or regulatory penalty.
                                                       Structural Breaks: Large shifts in data caused by significant events like mergers, acquisitions,                                                        or regulatory changes that fundamentally alter the companyâ€™s operations.
                                                       Anomalies, also known as outliers, refer to data points or events that deviate significantly                                                            from the expected pattern or behavior in a dataset. Unlike volatility, anomalies are unexpected                                                         and often indicate something unusual or incorrect in the data.
                                                       Anomalies are irregularities or outliers that stand out from the rest of the dataset. They often                                                        signal one-time events, errors, or extraordinary circumstances that deviate from normal patterns.
                                                       Volatility is an inherent characteristic of financial time series, reflecting regular ups and                                                           downs in stock prices, revenue, profit, or other metrics.
                                                       It represents the natural variability or uncertainty in a dataset, often measured by how much                                                           values deviate from a central trend or average.       
    
    + **Visualization and Interpretation:**
       + **Communicating Complexities** Creating time series plots for multiple companies and financial indicators without overwhelming the viewer,                                             ensuring clarity in identifying trends, peaks, and troughs.Tailoring visualizations to the audience, with                                               simplified visuals for non-experts and more granular data presentations for finance professionals.
